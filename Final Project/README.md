# Final Project Proposal

My final project is going to be a scene to a song. The idea is that there is a cat on a ship souring in the wide open space. Maybe a couple of plants by with stars moving. There will be some orbit control in the 3D space. 

2. Breakdown
Week1: find models or make models
Week2: start the threejs scene. Camera, lights, renderer, controls
Week3: add in the audio and models
Week4: planets.

3.This will be done using html/js in threejs.
